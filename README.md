This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This Todo App is developmental learning project using the [React Transition Group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group) (V2) and [React Motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion)


Can see a live version [here](http://brandenbuilds.com/portfolio/sandbox/todo-app/) (This is using React Motion and not React transition)

## Starting Project

### `npm start`

## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App-transition-group.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
```


To switch between libraries, change the name of the app.js file according. By default, the app.js is using the React Motion library.
